# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.
# Pseudocode:
# overall aim: save pdf files containing a specific word in a separate folder
# save all pdf files that should be searched in a folder (1)
# create empty folder (2) to save all "positive" pdf files
# write code that scans every file for the word in folder (1)
# and saves "positive" files in folder (2) without deleting them in folder (1)
